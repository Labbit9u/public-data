Please read on for more information regarding the next Traffic Calming Program Cycle. The recent passage of Proposition L ensures long term funding for the application-based traffic calming program, but the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA)  must develop a new expenditure plan before the next round of funding requests can be submitted. We are working with the SFCTA to determine a timeline for reopening traffic calming applications in association with this new expenditure plan. Currently, we expect the SFCTA will begin processing new allocation requests in May 2023, therefore we anticipate reopening the application-based traffic calming program process in July 2023. This may seem disappointing at first glance, but this timeline is a positive development for the future of the program. Under the existing program structure, applications are accepted over the course of an entire year, from July to June, then grouped together for evaluation beginning each fall, but under the new program structure we hope to establish as part of the new Prop L expenditure plan, applications will be accepted continuously and evaluated on a quarterly basis. To further explain, under the new structure all applications received between July and September 2023 should be evaluated between October and December 2023, then installation of recommended improvements on blocks that qualify should occur between January and June 2024, or about two years earlier than installation would have occurred under the existing program structure. The new process will then be repeated for each subsequent quarterly period. We are still working with the SFCTA on specifics and hope to announce more details on the website in the coming months about a revamped, more efficient, and more responsive application-based traffic calming program.
